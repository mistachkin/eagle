                 "Database": Omits features that do not work inside SQL Server.

      WARNING: Setting the "BaseIntermediateOutputPath" property breaks the

        NOTE: Keep all the intermediate files in one place.  The Visual Studio
              IDE seems to have a nasty habit of ignoring this setting.  The
              Visual Studio IDE then fails to build the project(s) properly when
              the output does not end up where it expects the output to be.
              When in doubt, build from the command line.  The "build.bat" tool
              in "Library\Tools" makes the command line build process fairly
              painless.  Please note that if you do not have the Eagle private
              keys (and most people will not), you will need to use the strong
              name bypass tool first (i.e. "Library\Tools\data\strongName*.reg"
              or "Library\Tools\strongName.bat").
